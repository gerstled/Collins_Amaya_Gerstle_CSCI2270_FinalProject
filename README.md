CSCI 2270 Final Project

Design a blackjack game simulator with the use of vectors and linked lists.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project Summary:

  We are designing and implementing a blackjack game in which we are using vectors and linked lists. We will be using a Player structure that includes a linked list for the player's hand. The game will have the option to play with multiple decks, just like in a casino. The decks will be held in a vector, with each node being a card. Then we will have a random generator to shuffle the cards (we will have no dealer, just the computer dealing). Each player is initially allocated a certain amount of money with which to place bets. The player can decide their bet amount for each round. If you bust, our program will tell the other players you busted. Bets are automatically handled at the end of each round, and the player's money is updated. We will follow standard rules and we will try our best to implement a GUI, however since we haven't learned anything about GUIs we have no promises.
